# Changelog

All notable changes to the `smix` workspace are documented here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) at the wire, ABI, and CLI surface.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **Parser** — `smix run` now accepts the `expect: { visible: <selector>, timeoutMs?: N }` and `expect: { notVisible: <selector>, timeoutMs?: N }` shapes emitted by `smix migrate` for `extendedWaitUntil`. The `expect: { visible: ... }` shorthand (no timeout, equivalent to `assertVisible`) is likewise accepted. Previously the parser only recognized the top-level `expect: { text | id: ... }` maestro-alias form, so codemodded corpora failed at run time with `expected 'text' or 'id' key`. Regression tests in `smix-adapter-maestro/tests/parser.rs` pin every accepted shape.
- **`smix migrate --help`** — help text corrected to state that comments, copyright headers, and blank lines survive the codemod byte-identical (matches 1.0.0's actual behavior).

### Added

- **`smix run --check`** — parse-only pre-flight. Reads every listed flow YAML and reports parse or include errors without connecting to a runner or booting a simulator. Exit 0 on clean parse across every flow; non-zero (2) on any error. Suitable for CI without simulator infrastructure.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-08

First public release.

### Added

- **CLI** — `smix` binary with subcommands `run`, `sim`, `runner`, `migrate`, `annotate`, `authoring`, `tree`, `find`, `tap`, `fill`, `clear`, `scroll`, `screenshot`, `describe`, `doctor`.
- **Rust SDK** — `smix-sdk` crate exposing the `App`, `Selector`, `KeyName`, and `Runtime` types plus a fluent builder for connection configuration.
- **TypeScript SDK** — `@goliapkg/smix` on npm; Playwright-shape API surface mirrored to the Rust SDK.
- **Swift SDK** — Swift Package published as a GitHub Release; provides a prebuilt `SmixCoreFFI.xcframework`.
- **Kotlin SDK** — `jp.golia.smix:smix-sdk` on Maven Central; UiAutomator-backed runner for the Android Emulator.
- **YAML runtime** — Maestro-compatible YAML syntax accepted directly (both maestro-canonical `tapOn` and smix-canonical `tap` forms).
- **Codemod** — `smix migrate` rewrites YAML from maestro-canonical to smix-canonical while preserving comments, copyright headers, and blank lines byte-identical.
- **Fixture registry** — `--fixture-registry <file.ts|file.json>` enables the `- fixture: <id>` YAML verb.
- **Metro log signals** — `expect.signal`, `expect.signals`, `expectLogClean`, and the `--metro-log-url ws:// | file:// | -` transport with configurable allowlists.
- **Annotation** — bundled Inter Regular and Noto Sans SC fonts; the `takeScreenshot` verb accepts `annotate:` clauses composing `circle`, `line`, `arrow`, `text`, and `box` primitives; `smix annotate` standalone CLI.
- **Auto-annotate on failure** — `--debug-output` fail-step PNGs receive an automatic red circle, step label, and summary; opt out with `--no-fail-annotate`.
- **JUnit output** — `smix run --format junit --output report.xml` writes a JUnit-XML testsuite consumable by common CI pipelines.
- **Authoring tier** — `smix authoring suggest`, `capture-tree`, `diff-tree`, and `record` for authoring flows against a live simulator or emulator.
- **Standard subflows** — bundled `std/wipe-app-state.yaml`, `std/wait-metro-bundle.yaml`, `std/quit-qa-mode.yaml`, `std/dismiss-open-in.yaml`, and `std/ensure-locale.yaml`.
- **MCP server** — `smix mcp` subcommand exposes the SDK surface to Claude Code and other MCP-aware clients.

### Stability commitments

- Wire format frozen — any breaking wire change is a v2.0 release.
- ABI frozen for the ten core "stone" crates (`smix-error`, `smix-selector`, `smix-screen`, `smix-runner-wire`, `smix-input`, `smix-verbs`, `smix-metro-log`, `smix-fixture`, `smix-annotate`, `smix-migrate`) — additive changes only within v1.x.
- All CLI flags shipped in v1.0 remain accepted for the v1.x lifetime.
- The YAML verb table (`smix-verbs`) is the single source of truth; removing a verb is a major-version change.
